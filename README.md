<h1 align="center">Pomodoro Timer</h1>

 <p align="center">A Pomodoro timer is a time management technique that helps improve focus and productivity. The timer is set for a specific duration, typically 25 minutes, known as a "Pomodoro." During this time, you concentrate on a single task without any distractions. After each Pomodoro, you take a short break, usually around 5 minutes. Once you complete a set of four Pomodoros, you can take a longer break, usually around 15-30 minutes.</p>

## Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

## Project

I developed a Pomodoro application that allows users to input a project name and customize the duration time. The application also provides functionality to save a list of activities(completed and interrupted for tracking purposes.
The purpose of this application is to showcase the usage of Hooks and Context within React, I intentionally implemented an over-engineered solution. The project demonstrates how these advanced features can be effectively utilized to enhance the application's functionality and maintain code organization.

## Goals

<p>The primary goals of this project were to develop a Pomodoro application while emphasizing the utilization of specific React hooks. I aimed to leverage the power of hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext to construct a robust application. By utilizing these hooks, I intended to enhance the application's state management, side effect handling, context sharing, and DOM manipulation. </p>
